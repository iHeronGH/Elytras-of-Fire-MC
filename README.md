# Elytras of Fire MC
This Minecraft datapack aims to recreate the world of "Wings of Fire" by author Tui T. Sutherland in-game!

How to Install:
1. Download the datapack (Clone or download -> Download ZIP)
2. Open your 1.16.X Minecraft world folder, then the "datapacks" folder (Main menu -> Singleplayer -> Select a world, then click Edit -> Open World Folder -> datapacks).
3. Unzip the .zip you downloaded. You should now have a folder called "Elytras-of-Fire-MC-master," and inside of that is a folder titled "elytras-of-fire". Drag the "elytras-of-fire" folder into the "datapacks" folder in your world.
4. Regardless of if you are already logged into your world or not, log into your world and/or type "/reload". If this does not show the welcome message, type /datapack enable "file/elytras-of-fire" first, then enter in /reload.
5. You're done! Enjoy the Elytras of Fire datapack!
